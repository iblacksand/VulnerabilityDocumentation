# Vulnerability Documentation

This is the documentation to test vulnerabilities in password managers found in the paper [Analysis on the Security and Use of Password Managers](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gtxjfrdntkyq). We have found five successful attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in Passbolt, Padlock and Encryptr.

### Attacks

* [Userscripts](#userscripts)
    * [Passbolt Fake Extension Installer](#passbolt-fake-extension-installer)
    * [Padlock Data Reset](#padlock-data-reset)
    * [Padlock Access Remover](#padlock-access-remover)
* [User Input Attacks](#user-input-attacks)
    * [Keylogger Attack](#keylogger-attack)
    * [Clipboard Reader](#clipboard-reader)

## Userscripts

Before you start using any of the userscript attacks, you need to use a userscript manager.

For Chrome, use [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).

For Firefox, use [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

### Installing Scripts

Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey should automatically install the userscripts when you click the given 

### Passbolt Fake Extension Installer

### Padlock Data Reset

### Padlock Access Remover

## User Input Attacks

Both user input attacks were built in C# for use only on Windows devices. They work in much the same way. Both of the attacks save plain-text logs with timestamps. Every 10 minutes, the attacks send the logs to our email and delete them from the victim's computer.

### Keylogger Attack

The keylogger saves every key press and click into a plain-text file. It attaches a timestamp at the beginning of each log and after 30 seconds of inactivity.

### Clipboard Reader

The clipboard reader checks once every second to see if the contents of the clipboard have changed. Every time it detects a change, it logs the timestamp and clipboard contents.

### Installation

Both of these attacks can be hidden in the installation of a different program and set up to run every time Windows boots up.
